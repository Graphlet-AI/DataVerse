       "' The history of mathematics deals with the origin of discoveries in mathematics and the mathematical methods and notation of the past. It began in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, who coined the term \"mathematics\". Greek mathematics greatly refined the methods and expanded the subject matter of mathematics. Chinese mathematics made early contributions, including a place value system and the first use of negative numbers. The Hindu–Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and were transmitted to the Western world via Islamic mathematics. From ancient times through the Middle Ages, periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in Renaissance Italy in the 15th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day.'"
