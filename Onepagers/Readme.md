# Onepagers
This folder contains a collection of onepagers for core python and python tools and frameworks. 
The purpose of this folder is to share and track changes in the onepagers, get feedback through github issues, and always have access to the latest version.

## Why Onepagers?
Cheatsheets are a helpful reference tool for developers, providing quick and easy access to important syntax, commands, and other relevant information. But recently I've notices several flaws of some of the pbulished cheatsheets:
- They are long (up to 50 pages `:scream:`)
- They become outdated (Have seen cheatsheets with deprecated functionality)
- No way to share feedback
- No way to track the latest version

Current repo folder is dedicated to solving above problems.
The folder structure will contain onepager readme with a low quality example of the onepager and links to images and pdf files of higher quality.
